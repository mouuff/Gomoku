# The Gomoku Project
## What is Gomoku ?

**Gomoku**, also called Gobang or **Five in a Row**, is an abstract **strategy board game**.
It is traditionally played with **Go pieces** (black and white stones) on a **Go board**, using **15×15** of the **19×19** grid intersections.
Players alternate turns **placing** a **stone** of their **color** on an **empty intersection**. The **winner** is the first player to form an **unbroken chain of five stones** horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## What is this ?

This project has the simple **goal** of writing a **Gomoku AI Engine**, capable of **playing by itself** and defeat you ! It respects and utilizes many paradigms of **artifical intelligence** and **search algorithms**, all the while being compliant with the **Gomocup [protocol](http://petr.lastovicka.sweb.cz/protocl2en.htm)**.


This AI is made for the **[Piskvork](https://gomocup.org/download/)** application
